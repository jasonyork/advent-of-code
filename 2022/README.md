# jasonyork's [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) solutions

## Overview

Goals for my solutions:
* Optimize for readability and comprehension.
* Use domain models whenever it makes sense.
* Prioritize test-driven development.

Each solution will have a `solution.rb` file with the primary purpose of parsing the input, calling domain model to solve the problem then emit the result.
